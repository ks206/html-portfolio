    <h1>The Best Movies According to Me</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies on <a href="https://www.hotstar.com/in/home?ref=%2Fin">Disney+</a></h2>
    <hr>
    <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hero_6_(film)">Big Hero 6</a></h3>
    <p>Agreeably entertaining and brilliantly animated, Big Hero 6 is briskly-paced, action-packed, and often touching. It was one of my favourite childhood movies.</p>
    
    <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(2009_film)">Avatar</a></h3>
    <p>It might be more impressive on a technical level than as a piece of storytelling, but Avatar reaffirms James Cameron's singular gift for imaginative, absorbing filmmaking.</p>
    
    <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sound_of_Music_(film)">The Sound of Music</a></h3>
    <p>Unapologetically sweet and maybe even a little corny, The Sound of Music will win over all but the most cynical filmgoers with its classic songs and irresistible warmth.</p>
